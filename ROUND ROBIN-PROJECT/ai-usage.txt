Chat GPT USES:

For finding where I needed to do the default priority allocation in page alloc
The need for the proctable spinlock in order to lock the whole process from start to after setting the found process to RUNNING
In general for understand some of the concepts when it came to writing my discussion document.
When I was having issues with my scheduler code I use chat gpt to help find if I had any glaring logic errors or non-useful code. So mostly for code simplification.


Overall it was much more useful for this PA in comparison to prior ones.
