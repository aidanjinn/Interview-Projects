I used chat gpt to first help with making any translation from c++ code into c code that I didn't remember the syntax for.
I didn't fully understand what the ode was really doing so I used chatgpt to explain to me what.
Most with indexing the pageref array since I didn't know the KERNBASE / PGSIZE
Also used it to explain the grading tests to me.
Overall the ai was mostly used to help explain certain sections of the already existing code.

For the most part it was used to interpret other code I found I didn't understand.
